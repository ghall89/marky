A command line tool, written in Go, to convert a Markdown file into a simple webpage.

## Installing

The executable downloaded from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ghall89/marky/releases) in your terminal.

## Building From Source

Run `make` or `make build` from the project directory. Binaries for macOS/Darwin, Linux, and Windows will be compiled to 'target/'.

## Usage

marky takes a single argument, the path to the Markdown file you'd like to convert.

A directory with name of your Markdown file will be created with the generated HTML and a CSS file. The webpage will then open in your default browser.
